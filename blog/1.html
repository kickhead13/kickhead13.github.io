I keep on writing code in short bursts of passion. I find a good project idea, I write a bunch of code
and after that I stop for a while... And then... I *try* to come back. But... I just can't read it. Or
I happend to find problems that need fixing, and the way the code is written just so happens to make
it harder to fix than it should be...

This problem is recurring. I am getting better though, so here is a short list of rules of thumb that
I've compiled over time and that helped *me* get better at making software.

1. <b>ALWAYS</b> commit

2. Comments <i>could</i> help, good names <b>always</b> do 

3. &le; 50

4. Never deploy manually

5. Nobody gives a <b>fuck</b> about your opinion

6. Seriously... not one person
